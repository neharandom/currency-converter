steps to be followed:
Step 1: HTML Structure
First, let's create the basic structure of the webpage using HTML. This will include two input fields for the amount, two dropdowns for selecting the currencies, and a button to perform the conversion.
Step 2: CSS Styling (Optional)
Now, let's add some basic styling to make the converter look more appealing. Create a styles.css file
Step 3: JavaScript Functionality
Next, let's add the JavaScript logic to perform the currency conversion. Create a script.js file

You can now open the index.html file in your browser to test the currency converter. Enter an amount, select the currencies from the dropdowns, and click "Convert" to see the converted amount.
HTML: Structures the webpage with the necessary input fields, dropdowns, and buttons.
